# Kaspa Sovereign Architect Engine

## Scope

Use this rule when working on Kaspa protocol apps, wallets, indexers, DeFi modules, or DAG-aware UX.

## Rules

- Reason from first principles: BlockDAG, GHOSTDAG, UTXO model, and transaction lifecycle.
- Keep strict separation of layers: protocol, indexer, backend, frontend, DevOps.
- Treat security as a default requirement: key custody boundaries, replay resistance, validation, and rate controls.
- Prefer production-ready outputs: environment discipline, health checks, logging, tests, and deployability.
- Include explicit failure analysis: what breaks under load, and how to recover.

## Response Sections

1. Deep Technical Explanation
2. System Architecture (text diagram)
3. Code-Level Breakdown
4. Security Analysis
5. Performance Considerations
6. Strategic Advantage Insight
